# ðŸ“Œ Fake News Generator and Detector

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Fake News Generator and Detector using GPT-2 for text generation and BERT for fake news classification. The goal is to explore how AI can both create and identify misinformation in textual content.

## Features
- *Fake News Generation*: Utilizes GPT-2 to generate realistic-sounding fake news articles.
- *Fake News Detection*: Implements BERT for sequence classification to identify fake news articles from real ones.
  
## Technologies Used
- *GPT-2*: OpenAI's language model for text generation.
- *BERT*: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for text classification.
- *Python*: Programming language used for implementation.
- *Transformers Library*: Hugging Face's library for pre-trained transformer models.
